# Text-based model comparison tools

## Modiff

Modiff is an under-development two-way model comparison tool that makes use of a line-based diff to find model element differences *efficiently*, this is, without having to match and fully compare all elements of two model versions.

## Munidiff

Munidiff is an Unified Format's compatible textual syntax to report model differences found by a two-way model comparison. It is the main reporting format of Modiff, and it has also been integrated with EMF Compare.

Munidiff [has been presented](https://doi.org/10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00145) at the 16th Workshop on Models and Evolution (ME 2023), which was a satellite event at ACM/IEEE 26th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS).
