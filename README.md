# Text based model comparison tools

## Modiff

Modiff is an under-development two-way model comparison tool that makes use of a line-based diff to find model element differences *effitiently*, this is, without having to match and fully compare all elements of two model versions.

## Munidiff

Munidiff is an Unified Format's compatible textual syntax to report model differences found by a two-way model comparison. It is the main reporting format or Modiff, but it has also been integrated with EMF Compare.
