Alfonso: mapping between left/right and to/from

a: left -> to (as it changes), right -> from
b: equivalent to a, no use in our case
c: left -> to, right -> from
d: same case as b

Unmodified EMFCompare use cases below.

This will try and list all possible "requirement" cases that can happen in a model comparison. For each use case, we will consider
two models, "left" and "right".

a - One business model object dependency - left changes 
	a1 - Object A (which references B with a single reference) and B are deleted.
	a2 - Object A (which references B with a many reference) and B are deleted.
	a3 - Object B is deleted and A references C instead of B (single reference).
	a4 - Object B is deleted and A references C instead of B (many reference).
	a5 - Several changes in the many reference.
	a6 - References changed in the children of a node removed. Object container is removed with a sub-container which contains an object referencing (single and many reference) "destination"
	
b - One business model object dependency - right changes 
	b1 - Object A (which references B with a single reference) and B are deleted.
	b2 - Object A (which references B with a many reference) and B are deleted.
	b3 - Object B is deleted and A references C instead of B (single reference).
	b4 - Object B is deleted and A references C instead of B (many reference).
	b5 - Several changes in the many reference.
	b6 - References changed in the children of a node removed. Object container is added with a sub-container which contains an object referencing (single and many reference) "destination"
	
c - many business model object dependency - left changes 
	c1 - Object A (which references B and C), B and C are deleted.
	c2 - Object A (which references B and C) and C are deleted.
	c3 - A reference to B (deleted) and C (deleted) is removed from object A.
	c4 - A reference to B and C (deleted) is removed from object A.
	c5 - A reference to C (deleted) is removed from object A.
	
d - many business model object dependency - right changes 
	d1 - Object A (which references B and C), B and C are deleted.
	d2 - Object A (which references B and C) and C are deleted.
	d3 - A reference to B (deleted) and C (deleted) is removed from object A.
	d4 - A reference to B and C (deleted) is removed from object A.
	d5 - A reference to C (deleted) is removed from object A.
	
e - 3-way tests - left changes

f - 3 way tests - right changes

h - resource attachment change tests
	h1 - resource attachment change on a deleted object
	h2 - resource attachment change on a added object
